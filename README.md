#TeamBuilder
TeamBuilder is a website intended for use by coordinators of university teamwork-based courses. It provides a simpler way to automatically generate student teams. based on whatever criteria the coordinator decides as most important.

##Surveys
In order to collect the information needed for an allocation, TeamBuilder allows the coordinator to create and send surveys to their students. These surveys can contain a variety of different questions, and a link to the survey will then be emailed to student email accounts. 

##Allocation
In order to perform allocation, TeamBuilder makes use of the [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) optimisation strategy, via the required [simanneal](https://pypi.org/project/simanneal/) library.
