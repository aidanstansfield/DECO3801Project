IntegerCountConstraint
	Integer field (e.g. age)
	"Each team <should/shouldn’t> have <BXY> members <with/without> [age] <BXY>."
	Cost is the difference between the given range and the actual number of students which meet the criteria.

IntegerAverageConstraint
	Integer field (e.g. age)
	"Each team <should/shouldn’t> have an average [age] <BXY>."
	Cost is the difference between the given range and the actual team average.

IntegerSimilarityConstraint
	Integer field (e.g. age)
	"Each team should have <similar/diverse> [age]."
	If similar:
		Cost is the team's standard deviation in the specified property.
	If diverse:
		Cost is the maximum possible standard deviation across the entire class, minus the team's standard deviation.

IntegerGlobalAverageConstraint
	Integer field (e.g. age)
	"All teams should have similar average [age]."
	Cost is the absolute value of the difference between the class-wide mean value and team-wide mean value.

OptionCountConstraint
	Option field (e.g. degree)
	"Each team <should/shouldn’t> have <BXY> members <with/without> [degree] <VALUE>."
	Cost is the difference between the given range and the actual number of students which selected the given option.

OptionSimilarityConstraint
	Option field (e.g. degree)
	"Each team should have <similar/diverse> [degree]."
	If similar:
		Cost is the number of team members who selected the team's most popular option, subtracted from the size of the team.
	If diverse:
		Cost is the number of team members who selected the team's least popular option, subtracted from the size of the team divided by the number of options available.

SubsetCountConstraint
	Subset field (e.g. interests)
	"Each team <should/shouldn’t> have <BXY> members <with/without> [interests] <VALUE>."
	Cost is the difference between the given range and the actual number of students whose selection included the given option.

SubsetSimilarityConstraint
	Subset field (e.g. interests)
	"Each team should have <similar/diverse> [interests]."
	If similar:
		Cost is the number of team members who selected the team's most popular option, subtracted from the number of team members who chose at least one option.
	If diverse:
		Cost is the number of team members who selected the team's least popular option, subtracted from the number of team members who chose at least one option divided by the number of options available.

BooleanCountConstraint
	Boolean field (e.g. postgraduate)
	"Each team <should/shouldn’t> have <BXY> members <with/without> [postgraduate]."
	Cost is the difference between the given range and the actual number of students which meet the criteria.
